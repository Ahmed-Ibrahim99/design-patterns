# Design Patterns

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various **Design Patterns** in Java. Each design pattern is implemented in its own branch to keep the repository organized and easy to navigate.

## Purpose

Design patterns are best practices for solving common software design problems. This repository provides a collection of examples demonstrating the usage of different design patterns. Each branch focuses on a specific pattern and includes detailed explanations and Java implementations.

## How to Use

1. **Cloning the Repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Ibrahim99/design-patterns.git
   cd design-patterns
    ```
2. **Checking Out Specific Patterns**:
   Each design pattern is implemented in a separate branch. To explore a specific pattern, check out its corresponding branch. For example:
    ```bash
   git checkout observer-pattern
   ```
   Here are the branches and their corresponding design patterns:

   - observer-pattern â€” Observer Design Pattern
   More patterns will be added over time!
